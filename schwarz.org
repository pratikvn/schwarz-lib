* MAIN SCHWARZ.
** General.
*** TODO Setup the push_one_by_one window to push directly from the solution vector.
*** TODO MPI_Init_thread ? 
*** BUGS: 
**** TODO onesided global tree checking has a bug.
*** OPTI:
**** TODO See if it is possible to directly communicate from the local vectors instead of gathering to the sol vec using the local_to_global function.
**** TODO GPU: Local_solution needs to be copied to the CPU send buffer and MPI_Put. Use Gather and Scatter operations for the accumulation in exachange_onesided. 
** GPU onesided:
*** TODO Check the tolerance checking if the squared tolerance needs to be passed in, especially in one-sided. 
** CPU threading:
*** TODO Use threading with pthreads to setup the 1 MPI rank per node and multiple node.
** Setting affinities:
*** TODO Setup a HWLOC interface similar to MGPU/Ginkgo to set GPU/CPU affinities.

* EVENT BASED.
