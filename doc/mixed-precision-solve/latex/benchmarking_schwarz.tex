\section*{\# Generic Benchmark settings. }

The flag {\ttfamily -\/\+D\+S\+C\+H\+W\+A\+R\+Z\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+B\+E\+N\+C\+H\+M\+A\+R\+K\+I\+NG} (default {\ttfamily ON}) enables the examples and benchmarking snippets.

If {\ttfamily schwarz-\/lib} has been built with {\ttfamily deal.\+ii}, then the {\ttfamily deal.\+ii} examples, {\ttfamily ex\+\_\+6} and {\ttfamily ex\+\_\+9} are also built, else only the {\ttfamily bench\+\_\+ras} example is built. The following command line options are available for this example. This is setup using {\ttfamily gflags}.

The executable is run in the following fashion\+:

```sh \mbox{[}M\+P\+I\+\_\+\+C\+O\+M\+M\+A\+ND\mbox{]} \mbox{[}M\+P\+I\+\_\+\+O\+P\+T\+I\+O\+NS\mbox{]}
